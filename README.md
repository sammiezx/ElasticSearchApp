# ElasticSearchApp
I used minimal react needed for the frontend with just a simple searchbar
I used NodeJS as the backend
And
I used #ElasticSearch as the database.

I used different ways to extract and 
get logical suggestions based on different queries 
i applied on a sample database of ecommerce orders
from #Kibana
