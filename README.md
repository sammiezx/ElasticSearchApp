# ElasticSearchApp
I used #ElasticSearch for the database system here.
I have used various queries and other advanced configurations to optimize retrivals.

I used different ways to extract and 
get logical suggestions based on different queries 
i applied on a sample database of ecommerce orders
from #Kibana

I used NodeJS as the backend
and minimal react needed for the frontend with just a simple searchbar
